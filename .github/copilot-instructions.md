# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This is a small Python project with the following files:
- `arguments.py`: Likely handles command-line arguments or configuration logic.
- `cpus.py`: May contain CPU-related logic or utilities.
- `trial.py`: Possibly for experimentation, testing, or main execution.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.
- `rotated.png`, `tripleten_logo.jpeg`: Image assets, possibly used in code or documentation.

## Architecture & Data Flow
- There is no framework or package structure; all code is in single Python files at the root.
- No configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `pyproject.toml`) or test directories detected.
- Each file is likely self-contained, but may import from others in the root.
- No evidence of external service integration or complex data flows.

## Developer Workflows
- **Dependencies:** Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Running code:** Execute scripts directly, e.g., `python arguments.py` or `python trial.py`.
- **Debugging:** No custom debug tools; use standard Python debugging (e.g., `print`, `pdb`).
- **Testing:** No test files found; if tests exist, they may be inline or manual.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- Flat file structure; all logic in root-level `.py` files.
- No custom build, lint, or CI/CD scripts detected.
- No documented code style or naming conventions; follow PEP8 unless code suggests otherwise.

## Integration Points
- Only external dependencies are those listed in `requirements.txt`.
- No evidence of API calls, database connections, or inter-process communication.

## Examples
- To add a new dependency: update `requirements.txt` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- To extend argument parsing: modify `arguments.py`.
- To add new logic: create a new `.py` file in the root or extend existing files.

## Key Files
- `arguments.py`: Entry point for configuration/argument logic.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependency management.
